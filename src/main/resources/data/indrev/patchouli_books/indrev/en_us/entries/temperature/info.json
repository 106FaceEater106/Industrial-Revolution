Machines should only heat up to explosion if you're inputting more energy than it's input limit.$(br)However, machines do have a temperature where they are more efficient and thus, processing is faster. After reaching this temperature, it should stagnate for as long as it's functioning."

To avoid this, check out $(l:temperature/coolers_and_fans)$(t:Go to Keeping it Cool!)Keeping it cool!$()$(br2)If the machine stops processing, the temperature will slowly start to decrease to the ambient temperature."
